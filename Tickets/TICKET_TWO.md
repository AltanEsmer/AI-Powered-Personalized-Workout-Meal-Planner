## Week 2 – Database & Authentication Setup for AI-Powered Workout & Meal Planner

### Description
In Week 2, focus on integrating Firebase Authentication and Firestore into the project. This involves setting up user authentication (login, signup, logout), establishing a secure connection with Firestore to store user data, and ensuring that both frontend and backend handle these systems seamlessly.

### Tasks

#### 1. Firebase Project Configuration
- **Firebase Console:**
  - Create (or update) your Firebase project.
  - Enable **Authentication** and set up your desired sign-in methods (e.g., Email/Password, Google Sign-In).
  - Enable **Firestore** and plan your database schema (e.g., collections for `users`, `workoutPlans`, `mealPlans`).
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Add Firebase configuration details (API keys, project ID, etc.) to your `.env` files for both frontend and backend.

#### 2. Authentication Integration
- **Frontend:**
  - Install and configure the Firebase client SDK.
  - Create a Firebase initialization module (e.g., `firebaseConfig.ts`).
  - Implement authentication functions:
    - Sign Up (email/password and/or Google Sign-In).
    - Login.
    - Logout.
  - Create UI components for login, signup, and a user dashboard.
- **Backend (Optional but Recommended):**
  - Install and configure the Firebase Admin SDK.
  - Set up middleware to verify Firebase ID tokens on protected API endpoints.
  - Test the integration by creating a secure API route that requires authentication.

#### 3. Firestore Database Integration
- **Database Structure & Schema:**
  - Define collections and documents:
    - `users`: Store user profiles and preferences.
    - `workoutPlans` & `mealPlans`: Store generated plans and history.
- **Frontend:**
  - Implement CRUD operations using the Firebase client SDK to read/write data.
  - Ensure secure data access by testing Firestore rules.
- **Backend (Optional):**
  - Implement API endpoints to handle data operations with Firebase Admin SDK.
  - Secure endpoints to ensure only authenticated users can modify/read data.

#### 4. Testing and Debugging
- **Local Testing:**
  - Validate the authentication flow (sign up, login, logout) in the browser.
  - Test Firestore operations from both the frontend and backend.
- **Common Issues & Solutions:**
  - **Incorrect API Keys:** Double-check the credentials in your `.env` files.
  - **CORS/Security Errors:** Update Firestore security rules and backend token verification logic.
  - **Token Verification Failures:** Ensure that Firebase Admin SDK is properly initialized and that the tokens are valid.

#### 5. Update Documentation
- Update your project’s documentation to include details about Firebase configuration, authentication flow, and database schema.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Firebase Authentication is fully integrated with sign-up, login, and logout functionality.
- Firestore database is connected with a clear data structure and secure access rules.
- Both frontend and (optionally) backend can perform basic CRUD operations on user data.
- Common setup issues are documented along with their fixes.

### Notes
- Collaborate with team members (if any) to refine the authentication flow and database schema.
- Keep sensitive keys secure and do not commit them to version control.
- Use Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing if needed.
